       "'a chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, bot, im bot, interactive agent, or artificial conversational entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.[1] such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the turing test. chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.\\n\\nthe term \"chatterbot\" was originally coined by michael mauldin (creator of the first verbot, julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.[2] today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as google assistant and amazon alexa, via messaging apps such as facebook messenger or wechat, or via individual organizations\\' apps and websites.[3][4] chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, hr, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.[5]\\n\\n\\ncontents\\n1\\tbackground\\n2\\tdevelopment\\n3\\tapplication\\n3.1\\tmessaging apps\\n3.1.1\\tas part of company apps and websites\\n3.2\\tcompany internal platforms\\n3.3\\ttoys\\n4\\tchatbot creation\\n4.1\\tdesign\\n4.2\\tbuilding\\n4.3\\tanalytics\\n4.4\\tmaintenance\\n4.5\\tchatbot development platforms\\n4.6\\tapis\\n5\\tmalicious use\\n6\\tsee also\\n7\\tcitations\\n8\\treferences\\nbackground\\nin 1950, alan turing\\'s famous article \"computing machinery and intelligence\" was published,[6] which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence. this criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human. the notoriety of turing\\'s proposed test stimulated great interest in joseph weizenbaum\\'s program eliza, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. however weizenbaum himself did not claim that eliza was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\\n\\n[in] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. but once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... the observer says to himself \"i could have written that\". with that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... the object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". few programs ever needed it more.[7]\\n\\neliza\\'s key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word \\'mother\\' with \\'tell me more about your family\\').[8] thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. eliza showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as \"intelligent\".\\n\\ninterface designers have come to appreciate that humans\\' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes. most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. this sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from weizenbaum\\'s \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\\n\\ndevelopment\\nthe classic historic early chatbots are eliza (1966) and parry (1972).[9][10][11][12] more recent notable programs include a.l.i.c.e., jabberwacky and d.u.d.e (agence nationale de la recherche and cnrs 2006). while eliza and parry were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. in 1984, a book called the policeman\\'s beard is half constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).[13]\\n\\none pertinent field of ai research is natural language processing. usually, weak ai fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. for example, a.l.i.c.e. uses a markup language called aiml, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, alicebots. nevertheless, a.l.i.c.e. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique eliza was using back in 1966. this is not strong ai, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.\\n\\njabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.\\n\\nchatbot competitions focus on the turing test or more specific goals. two such annual contests are the loebner prize and the chatterbox challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).[14]\\n\\naccording to forrester (2015), ai will replace 16 percent of american jobs by the end of the decade.[15] chatbots have been used in applications such as customer service, sales and product education. however, a study conducted by narrative science in 2015 found that 80 percent of their respondents believe ai improves worker performance and creates jobs.[citation needed]\\n\\napplication\\nsee also: virtual assistant\\n\\naeromexico airline chatbot running on facebook messenger, march 2018\\nmessaging apps\\nmany companies\\' chatbots run on messaging apps like facebook messenger (since 2016), wechat (since 2013),[16] whatsapp, livechat, kik, slack, line, telegram, or simply via sms. they are used for b2c customer service, sales and marketing.[17]\\n\\nin 2016, facebook messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. there were 30,000 bots created for messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by september 2017. [18]\\n\\nsince september 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on whatsapp. airlines klm and aeroméxico both announced their participation in the testing;[19][20][21][22] both airlines had previously launched customer services on the facebook messenger platform.\\n\\nthe bots usually appear as one of the user\\'s contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.\\n\\nmany banks and insurers, media and e-commerce companies, airlines and hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,[23] for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.[24][25]\\n\\na 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.[26] according to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.[27]\\n\\nas part of company apps and websites\\nprevious generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. ask jenn from alaska airlines which debuted in 2008[28] or expedia\\'s virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.[28][29] the newer generation of chatbots includes ibm watson-powered \"rocky\", introduced in february 2017 by the new york city-based e-commerce company rare carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.[30][31]\\n\\ncompany internal platforms\\nother companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for customer support, human resources, or even in internet-of-things (iot) projects. overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave.[32] other large companies such as lloyds banking group, royal bank of scotland, renault and citroën are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. a saas chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the f8 conference when zuckerberg unveiled that messenger would allow chatbots into the app.[33]\\n\\ntoys\\nchatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys.[34]\\n\\nhello barbie is an internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company toytalk,[35] which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.[36] these characters\\' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.[37]\\n\\nibm\\'s watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as cognitoys[34] intended to interact with children for educational purposes.[38]\\n\\nchatbot creation\\nthe process of creating a chatbot follows a pattern similar to the development of a web page or a mobile app. it can be divided into design, building, analytics and maintenance.[39]\\n\\ndesign\\nthe chatbot design is the process that defines the interaction between the user and the chatbot.[40] the chatbot designer will define the chatbot personality, the questions that will be asked to the users, and the overall interaction.[41][42] it can be viewed as a subset of the conversational design. in order to speed up this process, designers can use dedicated chatbot design tools, that allow for immediate preview, team collaboration and video export.[43] an important part of the chatbot design is also centered around user testing. user testing can be performed following the same principles that guide the user testing of graphical interfaces.[44]\\n\\nbuilding\\nthe process of building a chatbot can be divided into two main tasks: understanding the user\\'s intent and producing the correct answer. the first task involves understanding the user input. in order to properly understand a user input in a free text form, a natural language processing engine can be used.[45] the second task may involve different approaches depending on the type of the response that the chatbot will generate.\\n\\nanalytics\\nthe usage of the chatbot can be monitored in order to spot potential flaws or problems. it can also provide useful insights that can improve the final user experience.[46]\\n\\nmaintenance\\nto keep chatbots up to speed with changing company products and services, traditional chatbot development platforms require ongoing maintenance. this can either be in the form of an ongoing service provider or for larger enterprises in the form of an in-house chatbot training team.[47] to eliminate these costs, some startups are experimenting with artificial intelligence to develop self-learning chatbots, particularly in customer service applications.\\n\\nchatbot development platforms\\nthe process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms[48] offered by cloud platform as a service (paas) providers such as yekaliva, oracle cloud platform, snatchbot[49] and ibm watson.[50][51][52] these cloud platforms provide natural language processing, artificial intelligence and mobile backend as a service for chatbot development.\\n\\napis\\nthere are many apis available for building your own chatbots, such as aarc.[53]\\n\\nmalicious use\\nmalicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behaviour and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. they are commonly found on yahoo! messenger, windows live messenger, aol instant messenger and other instant messaging protocols. there has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service\\'s website.[54]\\n\\nsee also\\neugene goostman\\ninteractive online characters\\nlist of chatterbots\\nsocial bot\\ntwitterbot\\nsitepal\\ntay\\ncitations\\n \"what is a chatbot?\". techtarget.com.

born 7 july 1981) is an indian international cricketer who captained the indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. an attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket.[1][2][3][4] he is also regarded as one of the best wicket-keepers in world cricket and is known to have very fast hands.[5][6] he made his one day international (odi) debut in december 2004 against bangladesh, and played his first test a year later against sri lanka.\\n\\ndhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the icc odi player of the year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award in 2007, the padma shri, india\\'s fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the padma bhushan, india\\'s third highest civilian honour, in 2018.[7] he was named as the captain of the icc world test xi in 2009, 2010 and 2013. he has also been selected a record 8 times in icc world odi xi teams, 5 times as captain. the indian territorial army conferred the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel[8] to dhoni on 1 november 2011. he is the second indian cricketer after kapil dev to receive this honour.\\n\\ndhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an indian captain in tests, odis and t20is, and most back-to-back wins by an indian captain in odis. he took over the odi captaincy from rahul dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral odi series wins in sri lanka and new zealand. under his captaincy, india won the 2007 icc world twenty20, the cb series of 2007–08, the 2010 and 2016 asia cups, the 2011 icc cricket world cup and the 2013 icc champions trophy. in the final of the 2011 world cup, dhoni scored 91 not out off 79 balls handing india the victory for which he was awarded the man of the match. in june 2013, when india defeated england in the final of the champions trophy in england, dhoni became the first captain to win all three icc limited-overs trophies (world cup, champions trophy and the world twenty20). after taking up the test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in new zealand and west indies, and the border-gavaskar trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. in 2009, dhoni also led the indian team to number one position for the first time in the icc test rankings. in 2013, under his captaincy, india became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash australia in a test series. in the indian premier league, he captained the chennai super kings to victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of champions league twenty20. he announced his retirement from tests on 30 december 2014.[9]\\n\\nin 2011, time magazine included dhoni in its annual time 100 list as one of the \"most influential people in the world.\"[10] in 2012, sportspro rated dhoni as the sixteenth most marketable athlete in the world.[11] in june 2015, forbes ranked dhoni at 23rd in the list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his earnings at us$31 million.[12] in 2016, a biopic m.s. dhoni: the untold story was made about him.\\n\\ndhoni holds the post of vice-president of india cements ltd., after resigning from air india. india cements is the owner of the ipl team chennai super kings, and dhoni has been its captain since the first ipl season.[13][14] dhoni is the co-owner of indian super league team chennaiyin fc.[15] on 14 july 2018 during the second odi against england, dhoni became the first wicket-keeper for india and also became the fourth overall to take 300 catches in odis.[16] in the same match, he set another milestone for becoming the fourth indian and the 12th overall player to reach 10,000 runs in odi cricket, in fact went onto become only the second wicket-keeper batsman after kumar sangakkara to score 10,000 runs in odis.[17]\\n\\non september 28, 2018 he became the first indian wicketkeeper and third overall to register 800 dismissals in international cricket. [18]\\n\\ndhoni was born in ranchi, bihar (now in jharkhand),[19] and he identifies as a hindu rajput.[20] his paternal village lvali is in the lamgarha block of the almora district of uttarakhand. dhoni\\'s parents moved from uttarakhand to ranchi, where his father pan singh worked in junior management positions in mecon. dhoni has a sister jayanti gupta and a brother narendra singh dhoni.[21][22] dhoni is a fan of adam gilchrist, and his childhood idols were cricket teammate sachin tendulkar, bollywood actor amitabh bachchan and singer lata mangeshkar[23][24]\\n\\ndhoni studied at dav jawahar vidya mandir, shyamali, ranchi, jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. though he had not played cricket, dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the commando cricket club (1995–1998). based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season vinoo mankad trophy under-16 championship and he performed well.[22] dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard.[25] dhoni was a travelling ticket examiner (tte) at kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under south eastern railway in midnapore (w), a district in west bengal.[26][27][28] his colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the indian railways. but he also had a mischievous side to his personality. once, while staying at the railway quarters, dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. the night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. the story made big news on the next day.[29][30][31]\\n\\nin 1998, dhoni was selected by deval sahay to play for the central coal fields limited (ccl) team.[32] till 1998 dhoni, who was in class 12th in school, had played only school cricket and club cricket and no professional cricket. one of the famous episodes, when dhoni used to play for ccl, was when deval sahay used to gift him rs 50 for each six that he hit in sheesh mahal tournament cricket matches.[33] playing for ccl, he got a chance to bat up the order. he grabbed the opportunity and scored centuries and helped ccl move to the a division. deval sahay impressed by his hard-hitting shots and dedication, used his contacts in bihar cricket association to push for his selection in the bihar team.[34] deval sahay, an ex bihar cricket association vice-president, was the ranchi district cricket president at that time and was instrumental in pushing dhoni to the big stage of ranchi team, junior bihar cricket team and eventually senior bihar ranji team for the 1999–2000 season. within 1 year, dhoni moved from playing in ccl to the bihar ranji team. dhoni was included in the bihar u-19 squad for the 1998–99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. dhoni was not picked for the east zone u-19 squad (ck nayudu trophy) or rest of india squad (ma chidambaram trophy and vinoo mankad trophy). bihar u-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of the 1999–2000 cooch behar trophy, where dhoni made 84 to help bihar post a total of 357.[35] bihar\\'s efforts were dwarfed by punjab u-19s\\' 839 with dhoni\\'s future national squad teammate yuvraj singh making 358.[36][37] dhoni\\'s contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[38] dhoni made it to the east zone u-19 squad for the ck nayudu trophy[39] but scored only 97 runs[40] in four matches, as east zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[41]\\n\\ndhoni made his ranji trophy debut for bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. he made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against assam cricket team.[42] dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for bihar against bengal in the 2000/01 season, in a losing cause.[43] apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season[44] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four ranji matches.[45]\\n\\ndhoni\\'s performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the ranji trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the deodhar trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. in the 2003/04 season, dhoni scored a century (128*) against assam in the first match of the ranji odi tournament. dhoni was part of the east zone squad that won the deodhar trophy 2003–2004 season[46][47] and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches,[48] including a century (114) against central zone.[49]\\n\\nin the duleep trophy finals, dhoni was picked over international cricketer deep dasgupta to represent east zone.[50] he scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause.[51] dhoni\\'s talent was discovered via the bcci\\'s small-town talent-spotting initiative trdw. dhoni was discovered by trdo prakash poddar, captain of bengal in the 1960s, when he saw dhoni play for jharkhand at a match in jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the national cricket academy.[52]\\n\\nhe was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the one day format and was picked for the india a squad for a tour of zimbabwe and kenya.[53] against the zimbabwe xi in harare sports club, dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.[54] in the tri-nation tournament involving kenya, india a and pakistan a, dhoni helped india a chase down their target of 223 against pakistan a with a half-century.[55] continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120[56] and 119*[57] – against the same team. dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then indian captain – sourav ganguly[58] and ravi shastri, amongst others. however, the india a team coach sandeep patil recommended dinesh karthik for a place in the indian squad as wicket-keeper/batsman.[59]\\n\\nthe indian odi team in the early 2000s saw rahul dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn\\'t lack in batting talent.[58] the team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like parthiv patel and dinesh karthik (both india u-19 captains) named in the test squads.[58] with dhoni making a mark in the india a squad, he was picked in the odi squad for the bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[60] dhoni did not have a great start to his odi career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[61] in spite of an average series against bangladesh, dhoni was picked for the pakistan odi series.[62]\\n\\nin the second match of the series, dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. dhoni\\'s 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an indian wicket-keeper,[63] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.\\n\\ndhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the sri lankan bilateral odi series (october–november 2005) and was promoted to no. 3 in the third odi at sawai mansingh stadium (jaipur). sri lanka had set india a target of 299 after a kumar sangakkara century and, in reply, india lost tendulkar early. dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for india.[64] the innings was described in wisden almanack (2006) as \\'uninhibited, yet anything but crude\\'.[65] the innings set various records including the highest individual score in odi cricket in the second innings,[66] a record that still stands. dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346)[67] and was awarded the man of the series award for his efforts. in december 2005, dhoni was rewarded a b-grade contract by the bcci.[68]\\n\\n he rarely bowls at international level.\\nindia scored 328 in 50 overs with dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against pakistan. however, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to duckworth-lewis method.[69] in the third match of the series, dhoni came in with india in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help india take a 2–1 lead in the series.[70][71] the final match of the series had a repeat performance as dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable india win the series 4–1.[72] due to his consistent odi performances, dhoni overtook ricky ponting as number one in the icc odi rankings for batsmen on 20 april 2006.[73] his reign lasted just a week as adam gilchrist\\'s performance against bangladesh moved him to the top spot.[74]\\n\\ntwo cancelled series in sri lanka, one due to the withdrawal of south africa from the unitech cup due to security concerns[75] and the replacement three-match odi bilateral series against sri lanka washed due to rain,[76] was india\\'s prelude to another disappointing tournament – dlf cup 2006-07. dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. india\\'s lack of preparation showed in the 2006 icc champions trophy as they lost to west indies and australia, though dhoni scored a half-century against west indies. the story of the odi series in south africa was the same for both dhoni and india as dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and india lost the series 4–0. from the start of the west indies odi series, dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper syed kirmani.[77]\\n\\npreparations for the 2007 cricket world cup improved as india recorded identical 3–1 victories over west indies and sri lanka and dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.\\n\\nindia unexpectedly crashed out of the world cup after losses to bangladesh and sri lanka in the group stage. dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. after the loss to bangladesh in 2007 cricket world cup, the house that dhoni was constructing in his home-town ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of jmm.[78] the local police arranged for security for his family as india exited the world cup in the first round.[79]\\n\\ndhoni put his disappointing performances in the world cup behind him by scoring 91* against bangladesh, after india were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. dhoni was declared the man of the match for his performance, his fourth in odi cricket. he was also later adjudged the man of the series after the third game of the series was washed away. dhoni had a good afro-asia cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a man of the match innings, in the third odi.\\n\\ndhoni was named vice-captain of the odi team for the series against south africa in ireland and the subsequent india-england seven-match odi series.[80] dhoni, who received a \\'b\\' grade contract in december 2005, was awarded an \\'a\\' grade contract in june 2007. he was also elected as the captain of the indian squad for the world twenty20 in september 2007. on 2 september 2007, dhoni equalled his idol adam gilchrist\\'s international record for the most dismissals in an innings in odi by catching five english players and stumping one.[81]\\n\\nduring the series between india and australia, dhoni hit an aggressive 124 runs in just 107 balls, in the second odi, and a measured knock of 71 runs in 95 balls, along with yuvraj singh and saw india home by 6 wickets in the third odi. dhoni took his first wicket in international cricket on 30 september 2009. he bowled travis dowlin of the west indies during a match of the 2009 champions trophy.\\n\\ndhoni batting against south africa during the group stage match of 2013 icc champions trophy\\ndhoni topped the icc odi batsman rankings for several months in 2009. michael hussey from australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010.[82]\\n\\ndhoni had an excellent year in odis in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at an astonishing average of 70.43. dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in odis in 2009 along with ricky ponting, but the latter having played 30 innings.\\n\\nindia had a good start to the tournament beating bangladesh. dhoni led india to wins against netherlands, ireland and west indies in the group stage. while they lost to south africa and tied with england. india beat australia in the quarter finals and arch rivals pakistan in the semis. in the final clash with sri lanka at mumbai, dhoni played a knock of 91* to help india lift the cup.\\n\\non 12 february 2012, dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide india to their first win over australia at adelaide. in the final over, he hit a monstrous six which traveled 112 metres off the bowling of clint mckay. during the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the icc world cup final in 2011.[83]\\n\\nindia played a bilateral series against pakistan after first time in five years. in the three match odi series, dhoni was india’s highest scorer in all three matches. in the first odi at chennai, he rescued india from 29/5 to help india post a total of 227 in 50 overs. he played a composed and calm knock of 113* and had a record partnership with ravichandran ashwin. his efforts were in vain as india lost the series 2-1.\\n\\nthe 2013 champions trophy began in england and wales. dhoni led india to the top of group table beating south africa, pakistan and west indies. they comfortably beat sri lanka in semi final. the final against england was reduced to 20 overs due to rain. dhoni failed to make a mark with the bat, yet became the first captain to lift all three icc trophies. india beat england by 5 runs.\\n\\nin november 2013, dhoni became the second india batsman after sachin tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more odi-runs against australia.[84]\\n\\nindia toured south africa and new zealand in 2013-14 season. india lost both the series 0-2 and 0-4 respectively. he scored 65 and 19 against south africans while the third and final game was washed off. against new zealand, he managed 272 runs which included three consecutive fifties. his second fifty of the series in the third odi helped india tie the match and eventually avoiding a five-nil whitewash.\\n\\nindia won the away series against england in 2014 by 3-1 and home series against west indies 2-1. he had a good performance with the bat. he was rested for the home series against sri lanka which india won 5-0 under captaincy of virat kohli.\\n\\ndhoni again appeared in blue at the start of 2015. he led the team in tri-series against england and australia. india had a poor performance in the tournament and failed to win a single match.\\n\\nhe led india as the defending champions to world cup in australia. india finished the group stage on high beating arch rivals pakistan in their first match. dhoni had useful contributions in wins against west indies and zimbabwe scoring two fifties. india faced bangladesh in quarter final clash and won the match. in the process, dhoni became the first non-australian captain to win 100 odi matches. india suffered huge loss to australia in semis despite the some resistance he offered to australian attack. he made 65 but was run out. india ended the consecutive winning streak of 11 matches and dhoni failed to lift the cup twice unlike clive lloyd and ricky ponting.\\n\\nindia toured bangladesh in june and suffered a setback as they lost series 1-2. india also lost first bilateral home series against south africa in october 2015 by 2-3 margin. dhoni scores 92* in the second odi to help india register the first win of the tour.\\n\\nindia lost the series against australia 1-4 as dhoni failed to impress with the bat. yet, he had useful contribution in final match in sydney to help india chase 331. dhoni led a young indian side to series victory against zimbabwe in june 2016. he did not get a chance to bat but india won the series 3-0.\\n\\nin 2016-17 season, india beat new zealand 3-2. he scored a stylish 80 in third odi to help india chase 286. in meantime, he achieved the milestone to score 9000 odi runs.\\n\\ndhoni stepped down as captain of india in the limited over formats in january 2017, just ahead of the odi series at home against england.[85] in the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with yuvraj singh. the hundred, his tenth in odis, was his first in over three years.[86]\\n\\non 8 february 2018, dhoni became the first indian wicket-keeper to effect 400 dismissals in odi cricket, he achieved this feat during the third odi against south africa following the stumping of aiden markram.[87]\\n\\nfollowing his good one-day performance against sri lanka, dhoni replaced dinesh karthik in december 2005 as the indian teams\\' test wicket-keeper.[88] dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. dhoni came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed.[89] dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) helped india set a target of 436 and the sri lankans were bowled out for 247.[90]\\n\\nindia toured pakistan in january–february 2006 and dhoni scored his maiden century in the second test at faisalabad. india was in a tight spot when dhoni along with irfan pathan tried to steady the ship, with the team still needing 107 runs to avoid a follow-on. dhoni played in his naturally aggressive style as he brought up his maiden test hundred in just 93 balls after scoring the first fifty in just 34 deliveries.[91]\\n\\ndhoni followed up the century with some prosaic batting performances over the next three matches, one against pakistan that india lost and two against england that had india holding a 1–0 lead. dhoni was the top scorer in india\\'s first innings in the third test at wankhede stadium as his 64 helped india post a respectable 279 in reply to england\\'s 400. however, dhoni and the indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of andrew flintoff (14).[92] dhoni failed to collect the harbhajan singh delivery cleanly as flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as england set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that india was never in danger of threatening. a batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selection.\\n\\non the west indies tour in 2006, dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first test at antigua. the rest of the series was unremarkable for dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4 stumpings. in the test series in south africa later that year, dhoni\\'s scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second test against the proteas, as india lost the series 2–1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever test victory in south africa (achieved in the first test match). dhoni\\'s bruised hands ruled him out of the third test match.[93]\\n\\non the fourth day of the first test match at antigua recreation ground, st john\\'s, antigua during india\\'s tour of west indies, 2006, dhoni\\'s flick off dave mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by daren ganga. as the batsman started to walk back, captain dravid declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and dhoni stayed for the umpire\\'s verdict. while the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the west indies side, brian lara, wanted dhoni to walk off based on the fielder\\'s assertion of the catch. the impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and lara\\'s temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire asad rauf. ultimately, dhoni walked off and dravid\\'s declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and lara\\'s action was criticised by the commentators and former players. lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined.[94]\\n\\ndhoni scored two centuries in sri lanka\\'s tour of india in 2009, a series of three matches in which he led india to a 2–0 victory. with this feat, india soared up to the number one position in test cricket for the first time in history. india scored 726–9 (decl) in the third match of this series, which was their highest test total then.[95]\\n\\nhe played his last series in the 2014–15 season in india\\'s tour of australia captaining india in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2–0 before the sydney test. following the third test in melbourne, dhoni announced his retirement from the format.[96] in his last test, he effected nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past kumar sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined).[97] he also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by wriddhiman saha in 2018.[98] he finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.\\n\\ndhoni was a part of india’s first ever twenty20 international match. he made debut against south africa in december 2006. he was out for a duck but india won the match. he kept the wickets and effected one catch and a run out.\\n\\non 18 february 2018, dhoni created a new wicketkeeping record of having taken 134 catches in 275 t20is against south africa in the first t20i following the catch of reeza hendricks, this record was previously held by kumar sangakkara.[99]\\n\\nms dhoni was chosen to lead india in first ever world t20 in 2007. he made his captaincy debut against scotland but the match was washed off. thereon, he led india to the icc world twenty 20 trophy in south africa, with a victory over arch-rivals pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 september 2007, and became the second indian captain to have won a world cup in any form of cricket, after kapil dev.\\ndhoni captaining india in an odi in february 2012\\ndhoni was named the captain of indian squad for the inaugural icc world twenty20 held in south africa in september 2007.[100] india were crowned champions as dhoni led the team to victory against pakistan in a thrilling contest.[101] he went on to become the odi captain of the indian team for the seven-match odi series against australia in september 2007.[102] he made his debut as full-time test captain of india during the fourth and final test against australia at nagpur in november 2008, replacing anil kumble who was injured in the third test and who then announced his retirement. dhoni was vice-captain in this series up to that point.[103] india eventually won that test, thus clinching the series 2–0 and retained the border-gavaskar trophy. dhoni had previously captained india on a stand-in basis against south africa and australia, in 2008 and 2009 respectively.\\n\\nit was under his captaincy that india climbed to no. 1 in the icc test rankings in december 2009. after that, he managed to lead india in a series-levelling world championship of tests against the south africans in february 2010. india also managed to draw the test series 1–1 in south africa later that year.\\n\\nafter winning the 2011 icc cricket world cup final against sri lanka on 2 april 2011, with his match-winning knock of unbeaten 91, tendulkar heaped praises on dhoni, claiming him to be the best captain he has played under. tendulkar mentioned that it was dhoni\\'s calm influence that was rubbing off on all his teammates and described dhoni\\'s handling of pressure as incredible.\\n\\nonly eleven players have captained ten or more tests playing as a wicket-keeper. dhoni leads the table with 60 tests as captain, 35 ahead of mushfiqur rahim in second place.[104]\\n\\nin march 2013, dhoni became the most successful indian test captain when he eclipsed sourav ganguly\\'s record of 21 victories from 49 tests.[105] ganguly also said in an interview to a news channel that dhoni is the all-time greatest captain of india and he has a great record to support this credential.\\n\\nin august 2016, dhoni was selected as captain for india\\'s first tour to the united states, where india played two t20is against the west indies in lauderhill, florida.[106] india lost the first match on 27 august 2016, during which dhoni surpassed former australian captain ricky ponting to become the most experienced captain in international cricket.[107] during 2018 asia cup in india\\'s last super four match, against afghanistan, captain rohit sharma and vice-captain shikhar dhawan were both rested for the match. he was named captain of the side in their absence, and became the first cricketer to lead india 200 times in odis.[108]\\n\\nas captain of the indian cricket team, dhoni has seldom been suspended due to his team\\'s slow over rate. in december 2009, he was suspended for two odi matches against sri lanka by icc match referee jeff crowe as india was three overs short of the specified rate; virender sehwag acted as captain for the two matches in cuttack and kolkata.[109] in january 2012 dhoni was banned for the fourth test match against australia in adelaide as india was two overs short during the third test in perth.[110] sehwag captained the team in the adelaide test and wriddhiman saha kept the wickets. in the cb series in february, dhoni again faced a one-match ban for slow-over rate against australia.[111]\\n\\n\\ndhoni has captained india in two world cups. under his captaincy, india won the world cup in 2011 and reached the semifinals in 2015.\\n\\ndhoni played his first odi world cup in 2007 at the caribbean. india made an early exit from the tournament in the group stage. in 2007 cricket world cup, india was placed in group b with sri lanka, bangladesh and bermuda. rahul dravid captained the team in this world cup. in three matches india played, they managed to win only one against bermuda while losing the rest from bangladesh and sri lanka. in their first match against bangladesh, india was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. dhoni was out for 0. he stumped tamim iqbal, shakib al hasan and captain habibul bashar in the match but, india lost by 5 wickets. in the next match against bermuda, india posted the then

ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the bangladesh loss.\\n\\nunder dhoni\\'s captaincy, india won the 2011 world cup. in the final against sri lanka, chasing 275, dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before an in-form yuvraj singh. when he came to bat, india needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. he started building a good partnership with gautam gambhir. due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls but later accelerated with a greater frequency of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. befitting the occasion, he finished the match off in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler nuwan kulasekara and won the man of the match awardin final of world cup. later in the post-match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the muralitharan spin threat, as he was very familiar with murali\\'s bowling, who was his teammate in the indian premier league (ipl) franchise chennai super kings. he had come after the dismissal of virat kohli, also a right-handed batsman. by partnering the left-handed gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.\\n\\nthe bat used by dhoni in the final match was sold for ? 72
